# Time series analysis on social media data
IRE (major project)

## Problem Statement:
Combine time series analysis with natural language processing in order to understand sentiment change of unstructured textual data changes over time and test the practicality of using the statistics collected to predict future trends on social media data

## Dataset
We worked on over 800000 posts from Reddit Mental Health subreddits from 2 different time periods (Jan-Apr 2019 & Jan-Apr 2020). Some of the subreddits are r/depression, r/healthanxiety, r/mentalhealth, etc.

## Analysis

### Time-Series Analysis
Use various time series techniques to Compare trends of mental health subreddits between 2019 and 2020.

### Topic Modelling using LDA
Use the LDA Algorithm to Analyze various key topics within each subreddit.

## Models

### CRF with TF-IDF/BERT
Conditional Random Fields is a class of discriminative models best suited to prediction tasks where contextual information or the state of the neighbors affect the current prediction. We combine these with BERT and TFIDF to see which gives the best results.

### Hidden Markov Models
HMM is a state-space model, which uses observable data to estimate the status of a latent, or hidden, variable over time, provided useful insights.
